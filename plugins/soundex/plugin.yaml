    description: Soundex is a phonetic algorithm for indexing names by sound, as pronounced
      in English. The goal is for homophones to be encoded to the same representation
      so that they can be matched despite minor differences in spelling. The algorithm
      mainly encodes consonants; a vowel will not be encoded unless it is the first
      letter.
