    label: Levenshtein distance
    description: This method is used to align source and target’s IRIs whenever the
      distance of their respective user selected property values are above a given Levenshtein
      edit distance threshold. Edit distance is a way of quantifying how dissimilar
      two strings (e.g., words) are to one another by counting the minimum number of
      operations ε (removal, insertion, or substitution of a character in the string)
      required to transform one string into the other.
