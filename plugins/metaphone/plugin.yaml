    label: Metaphone
    description: Metaphone is a phonetic algorithm for a more accurate encoding of words
      by sound (as compared to Soundex) as pronounced in English. In this algorithm
      as with Soundex, similar-sounding words should share the same encoding key which
      is an approximate phonetic representation of the original word.

    label: Double Metaphone
    description: Double metaphone is a third generation phonetic algorithm improvement
      after Soundex and Metaphone for an accurately encoding words by sound as pronounced
      in English. It is called "Double" because it can return both a primary and a secondary
      code for a string; this accounts for some ambiguous cases as well as for multiple
      variants of surnames with common ancestry.
