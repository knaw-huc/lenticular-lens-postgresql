    description: The method aligns the source and the targetâ€™s IRIs via an intermediate
      database by using properties that potentially present different descriptions of
      the same entity, such as country name and country code. This is possible by providing
      an intermediate dataset that binds the two alternative descriptions to the very
      same identifier.
